        <p>As a designer, I want to create things that flow and that work well with the way that our bodies and minds natural function. I want anything that I design to be Human-Centered. I want to use good design that solves problems, not creates them. I would hope to create something that is beautiful, novel, but practical as well. </p>
        <p>I want my portfolio to not only show work I have done, but also to functionally work well and for people to be able to interact with it easily. I want them to see what I have learned and what I know how to do but also for them to learn more about me. </p>
        <p>My three strongest skills are, Programming competency, Leadership skills, and creative design.</p>
